Arduino Release Form.io
========================================

A form which automatically updates the *library.properties* file and creates a new release for the Arduino IDE's Library Manager! Make sure you head over to the [SparkFun Arduino Release Form Page](https://sparkfun.github.io/Arudino_Release_Form.io/) and fill in the fields to update your Arduino library's version number!

If you have Two Factor Authentication (2FA) enabled, you will need the code to create a release. You will need to:

* log out of GitHub
* re-login to GitHub but don't fully log in with the 2FA code received from SMS
* instead, add the received 2FA code in the tool

When finished, check your library's commit and the Arduino IDE's library manager.

_Note: The Arduino IDE's library manager may not recongize the update immediately. Remember the [Arduino library manager crawler runs every hour but it may take longer](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/wiki/Library-Manager-FAQ#how-is-the-library-list-generated). Make sure to be patient since the Arduino and wait a little before trying to search for the latest version for your library._
